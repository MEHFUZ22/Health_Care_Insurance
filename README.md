  <h1>Healthcare Insurance Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Project Description:</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to provide accurate predictions of patients' healthcare costs while identifying the key factors influencing these costs.
    The goal is to assist healthcare insurance providers in making informed decisions. The project involves gathering data from various sources,
    performing data cleansing and transformation, conducting comprehensive data exploration, testing hypotheses, and building advanced machine
    learning models. The primary tools utilized for data analysis and machine learning include Excel and Python, while SQL is employed for
    effective data management.
  </p>

  <h2>Objectives:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predict healthcare costs for patients and determine the factors that contribute to these predictions.</li>
    <li>Gain insights into the interdependencies among different factors and understand the significance of various tools throughout the healthcare cost prediction process.</li>
    <li>Test hypotheses related to hospitalization costs, types of hospitals, city classifications, smoking habits, and heart conditions.</li>
    <li>Develop and evaluate machine learning models using regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting algorithms to accurately predict costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Python: Utilized for data analysis and machine learning processes.</li>
    <li>Excel: Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.</li>
    <li>SQL: Used for efficient data management and retrieval.</li>
    <li>Tableau: Employed for data reporting and visualization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>
    This project successfully achieved accurate predictions of patients' healthcare costs and identified the significant factors influencing these predictions.
    In addition, hypotheses pertaining to hospitalization costs, types of hospitals, city classifications, smoking habits, and heart conditions were thoroughly tested.
    The project developed and evaluated machine learning models using regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting algorithms to ensure precise cost predictions.
    Python was utilized for data analysis and machine learning, Excel facilitated data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, while SQL enabled efficient data management and retrieval.
